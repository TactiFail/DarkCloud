# DarkCloud
A tongue-in-cheek "shell" written for an April Fool's presentation I gave at DC612

# Intro

For our April 2018 DC612 meeting, we decided to do a late April Fool's talk with 5 mini-presentations.  My talk was "Security Through Obscurity Done Right".  The premise was that we needed to apply the usually outward-facing obscurity to our internal networks.  DarkCloud is a Python shell that has a limited command set, and the commands it does support are...  weird.  Prompts change, it argues with you instead of running commands, sometimes arguments are added.  The point is to confuse attackers once they are in your network so they move on.

No, I will not be maintaining this.  Feel free to make a PR though.
